# Python Programming and Data Analysis on HPI data

The House Price Index (HPI) from gov.uk is a dataset used by many companies to track changes in the domestic housing market. This project uses Python explore this data, including writing a function to easily define column headings by index or name, and goes on to look at long- and short-term trends in the data.

### Features
- EDA
- Preprocessing
- Visualisation
- Data Analysis

### Techniques
- Function Writing
- Error Handling
- Memory Management
- Statistics
- Boxplots

## Summary
1. The House Price Index (HPI) dataset from gov.uk was explored.
2. A function and dictionary were used to identify column names using the gov.uk definitions.
3. New summary columns were created and the dataset reduced.
4. 10-year trends were visualised in a scatterplot and interpreted.
5. Short-term trends were examined using boxplots and probability density plots and outcomes discussed.
